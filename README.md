# North American High Speed Rail - Gravity Model Analysis
## Author [Rohan Dawar](https://www.rohandawar.com/)

### In this project I analyze the viability of North American High Speed Rail Routes using a Gravity Model.
### The Gravity between two cities (metro areas) is the product of their populations divided by the distance between them squared.
### [Check out my blog post on this project](https://www.rohandawar.com/post/high-speed-rail-in-north-america)!
